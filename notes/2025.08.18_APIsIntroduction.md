1. APIs Introduction

API stands for Application Programming Interface.
It’s basically a bridge that allows two programs or systems to communicate with each other, exchanging data or instructions in an organized way. [Não esquecer, o frontend comunica com o backend, e o backend comunica tanto com o frontend como o infra - ![alt text](<Captura de ecrã 2025-08-18 192055.png>) ---> O frontend não comunica diretamente com database, por motivos de seguranças (sobretudo), mas também por questões de processamento e carregamento de informação]

    - Think of an API as a restaurant menu:
a. The menu lists the dishes (the available functions);
b. You order a dish from the waiter (you make a request);
c. The waiter takes the order to the kitchen (the internal system);
d. The kitchen prepares and gives back the meal (the response).

No need to know how they cook it — you just follow the menu.

    - Why do we use APIs?
a. Reusability – no need to reinvent the wheel; you use existing functions;
b. Integration – different applications can work together;
c. Security – the system controls what is exposed without revealing everything;
d. Efficiency – saves development time.

    - Key fundamentals:
a. Endpoint – like an address in the API (a “door” to request something specific);
b. Request – the message you send to the API;
c. Response – the message the API sends back.

    - Common/Main methods (in Web APIs using REST):
a. GET – fetch information (e.g., “show me user #5”);
b. POST – used to create new resources. For instance, if the manager of an e-commerce store wanted to add a new product to the database, they would send a POST request to the /products endpoint. Unlike GET requests, POST requests typically include a request body, which is where the client specifies the attributes of the resource to be created.;
c. PUT – used to replace an existing resource with an updated version. This method works by replacing the entire resource (i.e., the specific product located at the /products/123 endpoint) with the data that is included in the request’s body;
d. PATCH - used to update an existing resource. It is similar to PUT, except that PATCH enables clients to update specific properties on a resource—without overwriting the others. For instance, if you have a product resource with fields for name, brand, and price, but you only want to update the price, you could use the PATCH method to send a request that only includes the new value for the price field. The rest of the resource would remain unchanged. This behavior makes the PATCH method more flexible and efficient than PUT;
e. DELETE – used to remove data from a database. When a client sends a DELETE request, it is requesting that the resource at the specified URL be removed. For example, a DELETE request to the /products/123 endpoint will permanently remove the product with an ID of 123 from the database;
f. HEAD

    - Data format --> usually JSON (structured text, easy for both humans and machines to read).

    - Authentication --> many APIs require an access “key” or token to make sure only authorized people/systems use them.

    - query params --> tudo o que segue depois do ?, e separado por &.

2. Exercício: construir uma API que diga 'Hello World', e depois colocar o nome. Em typescript e java.
[ typesript com Node
maybe express
